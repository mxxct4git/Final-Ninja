## Inspiration  
When finals approach, many students fall into the "procrastination-anxiety-more procrastination" cycle. The real issue isn’t a lack of study materials—it’s a lack of motivation and clear planning. Our goal is to help students go from "I should study" to "I’m actually studying"—and doing so efficiently. 

🎮 **The Power of Gamification**: Apps like Duolingo make learning addictive with streaks and rewards. We want to bring that same energy to finals prep with achievements + leaderboards to fuel motivation.  

🤖 **AI That Does More Than Just Chat**: Assistants like Manus AI don’t just think, they act by handling browser tasks, organizing data, and more. We want our AI to not just plan your study sessions, but also fetch your materials, highlight key points, and create quizzes, so you can focus on learning.  

🧠 **ADHD-Friendly Reading Mode**: Many students struggle with focus. Our tool will include custom reading modes to make learning materials easier to digest.
