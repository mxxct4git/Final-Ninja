    "5225": "This course is designed to impart a fundamental understanding of cloud computing, a contemporary backend solution pivotal to many IT applications. It combines theoretical learning and practical applications to prepare students to operate within the cloud computing landscape.\n\nThe course's structure is designed to gradually build on knowledge. It begins with an outline of the unit, followed by an examination of the intricate challenges associated with distributed systems. This leads smoothly into an introduction to cloud computing itself.\n\nThe course covers on-demand resource provision, subscription-based services, and pay-as-you-go models, granting students insights into the cloud's economic and functional operations. In addition, students will learn how cloud technology facilitates the implementation, maintenance, and management of coordinated computation and storage services.\n\nThe course goes a step further to educate students on designing and implementing cloud applications using these services. Crucially, it also addresses the topic of security and privacy concerns in off-the-shelf cloud services, thereby rounding off a comprehensive look into cloud computing.\n\nThe learning activities are designed to foster understanding of various cloud delivery and service models, identification of diverse cloud platforms, and key cloud technologies such as virtualisation, containers, serverless, and web services, including their associated security challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, this course is a well-rounded study of cloud computing, perfectly suited for those interested in mastering the dynamics of the technology."
