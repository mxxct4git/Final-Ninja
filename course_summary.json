    "9136": "FIT9136 Week 1 is all about getting you started with Python and understanding Big O Notation, which helps you analyze how fast your code runs as input size grows. Youâ€™ll learn Python basics, like variables, loops, and functions, while also diving into efficiencyâ€”because writing code that works is good, but writing code that scales is ninja-level. To master this, practice daily, test different input sizes, and always ask: Can this be faster? Donâ€™t just memorizeâ€”experiment, debug, and break things (then fix them). Speed matters, both in coding and learningâ€”so keep sharpening your skills, one line at a time! ðŸš€"
