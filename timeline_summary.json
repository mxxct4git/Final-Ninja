    "ai_summary": "Time to go full ninja mode on this! Youâ€™ve got six assignments, and timing is key. Start by tackling FIT5046 Assessment 3 ASAPâ€”itâ€™s only 20% but lays the foundation for your Android App Development (40%), so nailing this early will make the next phase smoother. Meanwhile, FIT5126â€™s Literature Review + Proposal (15%) should be prioritized, as it feeds directly into your Final Thesis (80%)â€”break it into research, drafting, and refinement stages to avoid a last-minute panic. By mid-term, shift focus to the Interim Presentation Video, treating it as a rehearsal for your Final Presentation (5%). Keep a strict timeline, avoid bottlenecks, and iterate fastâ€”small consistent wins beat last-minute cramming. Stay sharp, plan wisely, and execute with precision! ðŸš€"
